Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)
➢ IIoT can be described as an interconnection of a large number 
of industrial processes and systems, which communicate and 
coordinate among themselves.
➢ The real time data collected from sensor nodes are stored, 
processed, and analysed to improve the performance and 
efficiency of the overall system. 
➢ As shown in the figure, the sensor nodes deployed at various 
industrial locations sense and transmit data to the server. The 
real time processing and complex analysis of the data help to 
optimize various industrial processes such as predictive 
maintenance of machines, inventory management and 
packaging of finished products.",mech-slides.pdf,Page 618

Applications of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)
1) Smart healthcare – Sensor nodes sense and transmit the 
physiological data of the patient to the local processing unit. 
Further, the LPU transmits the data to the local server. Medical 
experts can remotely observe the health conditions of the patient.
2) Smart supply chain -  Proper maintenance of the raw materials, 
available inventory stock, details of each steps involved in the 
production process, proper flow of information among various 
stages , maintaining the time window for delivery of goods, and 
returning the faulty goods. 
3) Smart transportation – The sensor nodes placed on the vehicles 
and road side units (RSU) sense and transmit data to the local 
server. Various real time info such as safe speed, safe distance 
with the neighboring vehicles, and weather conditions are 
conveyed to the drivers.",mech-slides.pdf,Page 619

Applications of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)
4) Smart manufacturing system – These improve the efficiency of 
production and product quality, reduce the per unit cost of production 
and enhance the life time of machines and developed products.
e.g., Automatic packaging of a production in a manufacturing plant 
with minimum human intervention. 
5) AR and VR applications – Augmented reality and virtual reality 
have widespread applications in the optimization stages of 
manufacturing industries, inventory management in warehouses, 
training of personnel in military, healthcare, and assembly line 
operations.",mech-slides.pdf,Page 620

Programmable automation:
Some of the features that characterize programmable automation 
include: 
• High investment in general-purpose equipment 
• Low production rates relative to fixed automation 
• Flexibility to deal with changes in product configuration 
• Most suitable for batch production",mech-slides.pdf,Page 601

Machining and Robotics 
Programmable automation:
• In programmable automation, the production equipment is designed with the capability 
to change the sequence of operations to accommodate different product configurations
• New programs can be prepared and entered into the equipment to produce new 
products
• Automated production systems that are programmable are used in low and medium- 
volume production
• The parts or products are typically made in batches
• To produce each new batch of a different product, the system must be reprogrammed 
with the set of machine instructions that correspond to the new product",mech-slides.pdf,Page 600
